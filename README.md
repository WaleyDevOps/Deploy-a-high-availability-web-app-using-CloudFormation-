In this project (Udagram App), I deployed web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. I wrote the script that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Udagram app from the ground up. The script begin deploying the networking components followed by servers, security roles, and a sample website files located in a public S3 Bucket to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.
